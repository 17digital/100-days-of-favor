								<h2><i>Psalm 91:1-16 Amp</i></h2>
								<ol>
									<li>He who dwells in the shelter of the most high Will remain secure and rest in the shadow of the almighty [whose power no enemy can withstand].</li>
									<li>I will say of the Lord, "He is my refuge and my fortress, My God, in whom I trust [with great confidence, and on whome I rely]!"</li>
									<li>For He will save you from the trap of the fowler, and from the deadly pestilence.</li>
									<li>He will cover you and completely protect you with his pinions, and under His wings you will find refuge; His faithfullness is a shield and wall.</li>
									<li>You will not be afraid of the terror of night, nor of the arrow that flies by day,</li>
									<li>Nor of the pestilence that stalks in darkness, nor of the destruction (sudden death) that lays waste at noon.</li>
									<li>A thousand may fall at your side and ten thousand at your right hand, but danger will not come near you.</li>
									<li>You will only [be a spectator as you] look on with your eyes and witness the [divine] repayment of the wicked [as you watch safetly from the shelter of the Most High].</li>
									<li>Because you have made the Lord, [who is] my refuge, even the Most High, your dwelling place,</li>
									<li>No evil will befall you, nor will any plague come near your tent.</li>
									<li>For He will command His Angels in regard to you, To protect and defend and guard you in all your ways [of obedience and service].</li>
									<li>They will lift you up in their hands, so that you do not [even] strike your foot against a stone.</li>
									<li>You will tread upon the lion and cobra; the young lion and the serpent you will trample underfoot.</li>
									<li>Because he set his Love on Me, therefore I will save him; I will set him [securely] on high, because he knows my name [He confidently trust and relies on me, knowing I will never abandon him, No, Never].</li>
									<li>He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him and honor him</li>
									<li>With a long life I will satisfy him and I will let him see my salvation</li>
								</ol>
								
								<h2><i>Philippians 4:4-9 Amp</i></h2>
								<ol start="4">
									<li>Rejoice in the Lord always [delight, take pleasure in Him]; again I will say, rejoice!</li>
									<li>Let your gentle spirit [your graciousness, unselfishness, mercy, tolerance, and patience] be known to all people. <strong>The Lord is near</strong>.</li>
									<li>Do not be anxious or worried about anything, but in everything [every circumstance and situation] by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, continue to make your [specific] requests know to God.</li>
									<li>And the peace of God [that peace which reassures the heart, that peace] which transcends all understanding, [that peace which] stands guard over your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus [is yours].</li>
									<li>Finally, <strong>believers</strong>, whatever is true, whatever is honorable and worthy of respect, whatever is right and confirmed by God's Word, whatever is pure and wholesome, whatever is lovely and brings peace, whatever is admirable and of good repute; if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, <mark>think continually</mark> on these things [center your mind on them, and implant them in your heart].</li>
									
									<li>The things which you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice these things [in daily life], and the God [who is the source] of peace and well-being will be with you.</li>
								</ol>
								
								<h2><i>Psalm 23:1-6 Amp</i></h2>
								<ol>
									<li>The Lord is my Shepherd [to feed, to guide and to shield me], I shall not want.</li>
									<li>He lets me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside the still and quiet waters.</li>
									<li>He refreshes and restores my soul (life); He leads me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake</li>
									<li>Even though I walk through the [sunless] valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod [to protect] and Your staff [to guide], they comfort and console me.</li>
									<li>&#9733;<mark>You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies</mark>. You have anointed and refreshed my head with oil; My cup overflows.</li>
									<li>Surely goodness and mercy and unfailing love shall follow me all the days of my life, And I shall dwell forever [throughout all my days] in the house and in the presence of the Lord.</li>
								</ol>
								
								<h2><em>Proverbs 3:13-18</em></h2>
								<ol start="13">
									<li>Happy is the man who finds wisdom, and the man who gains understanding</li>
									<li>For Her proceeds are better than the profits of silver, and Her gain than fine gold</li>
									<li>She is more precious than rubies and all the things you may desire cannot compare with Her</li>
									<li>Length of days is in Her right hand, in Her left hand riches and honor.</li>
									<li>Her ways are ways of pleasanteness and all Her paths are Peace</li>
									<li>She is a tree of Life to those who take hold of Her, and Happy are all who retain Her</li>
								</ol>
								
								<h2><em>Romans 8:32</em></h2>

								</ol>
								
								<h2><em>Psalm 110:1-2</em></h2>
								<ol>
									<li>The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at My right hand, Till I make Your enemies Your footstool."</li>
									<li>The Lord shall send the rod of Your strength out of Zion. Rule in the midst of Your enemies!
								</ol>
								
								<h2><em>Psalm 1:1-3</em></h2>
								<ol>
									<li>Blessed is the man Who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, Nor stands in the path of sinners, Nor sits in the seat of the scornful;</li>
									<li>But his delight is in the law of the Lord, And in His law he meditates day and night.</li>
									<li>&#9733;<mark>He shall be like a tree Planted by the rivers of water, That brings forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also shall not wither; And whatever he does shall prosper.</mark> </li>
								</ol>
								
								<h2><em>Psalm 127:1-2</em></h2>
								<ol>
									<li>Unless the Lord builds the house, They labor in vain who build it; Unless the Lord guards the city, The watchman stays awake in vain.</li>
									
									<li>&#9733;<mark>It is vain for you to rise up early, To sit up late, To eat the bread of sorrows; For so He gives His beloved sleep.</mark> </li>
								</ol>
								
								<h2><em>John 14:27</em></h2>
								<ol start="27">
									<li>Peace (Shalom) I leave with you, My peace (shalom) I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.</li>
								</ol>
								
								<h2><em>John 14:12-13</em></h2>
								<ol start="12">
									<li>“Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father.</li>
									<li>And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</li>
								</ol>
								
								<h2><em>Jeremiah 17:7-8</em></h2>
								<ol start="7">
									<li>“Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, And whose hope is the Lord.</li>
									<li>For he shall be like a tree planted by the waters, Which spreads out its roots by the river, And will not fear when heat comes; But its leaf will be green, And will not be anxious in the year of drought, Nor will cease from yielding fruit.</li>
								</ol>
								
								<h2><em>Isaiah 65:24</em></h2>
								<ol start="24">
									<li>It shall also come to pass that before they call, I will answer; and while they are still speaking, I will hear.</li>

								<h2><em>Psalm 118:1-25 (Amp)</em></h2>
								<ol>
									<li>O give thanks to the Lord, for He is good; For His lovingkindness endures forever.</li>
									<li>Oh let Israel say, “His lovingkindness endures forever.” </li>
									<li>Oh let the house of Aaron say, “His lovingkindness endures forever.”</li>
									<li>Oh let those who [reverently] fear the Lord, say, “His lovingkindness endures forever.”</li>
									<li>Out of my distress I called on the Lord; The Lord answered me and set me free.</li>
									<li><mark>The Lord is on my side; I will not fear. What can [mere] man do to me?</mark></li>
									<li>&#9733;The Lord is on my side, He is among those who help me; Therefore I will look [in triumph] on those who hate me.</li>
									<li>It is better to take refuge in the Lord Than to trust in man.</li>
									<li>It is better to take refuge in the Lord Than to trust in princes.</li>
									<li>All nations encompassed me; In the name of the Lord I will surely cut them off. </li>
									<li>They encompassed me, yes, they surrounded me [on every side]; In the name of the Lord I will cut them off.</li>
									<li>They swarmed around me like bees; They flare up and are extinguished like a fire of thorns; In the name of the Lord I will surely cut them off.</li>
									<li>You [my enemy] pushed me violently so that I was falling, <mark>But the Lord helped me.</mark></li>
									<li><strong>The Lord is my strength and song</strong>, And He has become my salvation.</li>
									<li>The sound of joyful shouting and salvation is in the tents of the righteous: The right hand of the Lord does valiantly.</li>
									<li>The right hand of the Lord is exalted; The right hand of the Lord does valiantly.</li>
									<li><mark>I will not die, but live,</mark> And declare the works and recount the illustrious acts of the Lord</li>
									<li>The Lord has disciplined me severely, But He has not given me over to death.</li>
									<li>Open to me the [temple] gates of righteousness; I shall enter through them, I shall give thanks to the Lord.</li>
									<li>This is the gate of the Lord; The righteous will enter through it.</li>
									<li>I will give thanks to You, for You have heard and answered me; And You have become my salvation [my Rescuer, my Savior].</li>
									<li><mark>The stone which the builders rejected Has become the [a]chief corner stone.</mark></li>
									<li>This is from the Lord and is His doing; It is marvelous in our eyes.</li>
									<li>This [day in which God has saved me] is the day which the Lord has made; Let us rejoice and be glad in it.</li>
									<li>O Lord, save now, we beseech You; O Lord, we beseech You, <mark>send now prosperity and give us success!</mark></li>
								</ol>

								<ol start="4">
									<li>If you sift through all the clamor of everything around you to seek Her (Wisdom) like some precious prize, to search for Her like buried treasure;</li>
									<li>Then you will grasp what it means to truly respect the Eternal, and you will have discovered the knowledge of the One true God.</li>
									
								</ol>
								
								<h2><em>Isaiah 41:10-13 (AMP)</em></h2>
								<ol start="10">
									<li>Do not fear [anything], for I am with you; Do not be afraid, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, be assured I will help you; I will certainly take hold of you with My righteous right hand [a hand of justice, of power, of victory, of salvation].</li>
									<li>“Indeed, all those who are angry with you will be put to shame and humiliated; Those who strive against you will be as nothing and will perish.</li>
									<li>“You shall search for those who quarrel with you, but will not find them; They who war against you will be as nothing, as nothing at all.</li>
									<li>For I the Lord your God keep hold of your right hand; [I am the Lord], Who says to you, ‘Do not fear, I will help you. </li>
									
								</ol>
