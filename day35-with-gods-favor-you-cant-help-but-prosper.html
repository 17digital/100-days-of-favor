								<h2><i>Today's Scripture</i></h2>
								<blockquote>…though a righteous man falls seven times, he rises again...&#8212;Proverbs 24:16 NIV</blockquote>
								
								<p>When the unmerited favor of God is upon you wherever you are, like it was upon Joseph, (1) you cannot help but find favor, (2) everything that you do cannot help but to prosper, and (3) you cannot help but experience increase in promotion beyond your wildest imagination!</p>
								
								<h3>Your lowest points are launching pads to God's greatest promotions.</h3>
								
								<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Can you see that this was the consistent pattern in Joseph's life? It didn't matter if he was a slave or prisoner. The same applies to you. When the unmerited favor of God is upon you, you are like a rubber ball in a pool of water. Natural circumstances can try to push you down and keep you suppressed underwater, but the unmerited favor of God will always cause you to POP right up to the top!</p>
								
																
								<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Don't be discouraged by your current circumstances. I know things may sometimes appear bleak, dismal and perhaps even devastating, but it ain't over, my friend. I wrote this book to tell you that it ain't over! I don't believe for one moment that among the millions of books in publication right now, you are holding this particular one by chance or coincidence. This is a divine appointment and I believe that God is saying this to you: "Don't give up. It ain't over!"</p>
								
								<p style="text-indent: 30px;">There are many times where the lowest points in your life are actually launching pads to God's greatest promotion in your life. It was so for Joseph! Let's rewind the tape and observe the fingerprints of the Lord through the ups and downs of Joseph's life. If Joseph had not been betrayed by his brothers, he would not have been sold as a slave. If he had not been sold as a slave, he would not have been in Potiphar's house. If he was not in Potiphar's house, he would not have been thrown into an Egyptian prison meant specifically for the King's prisoners. If he was not in that specific prison, he would not have interpreted the dreams of Pharaohs officers. If he had not interpreted their dreams, he would not have been summoned to interpret Pharaohs dream two years later. If he had not interpreted Pharaoh's dream, pharaoh would not have promoted Joseph to become his Prime Minister over the entire Egyptian empire!</p>
								
								<p style="text-indent: 30px;">This is what Pharaoh said to Joseph: "inasmuch as God has shown you all this, there is no one as discerning and wise as you. You shall be over my house, and all my people shall be ruled according to your word; only in regard to the throne will I be greater than you… See, I have sent you over all the land of Egypt" (Genesis 41:39-41). When we look back, it is clear that the Lord had turned Joseph's darkest hour into the finest hour!</p>
								
								<p style="text-indent: 30px;">God's presence with Joseph and His unmerited favor caused Joseph to be promoted from the pit to the palace, from the dunghill to Capitol Hill, from the outhouse to the White House. Stop looking at your circumstances and stop allowing them to discourage you. The same Lord who was with Joseph is with you right now. You cannot fail! You can expect to see success beyond your present circumstances!</p>
								
				
															
															
								<h2><i>Today's Prayer</i></h2>
								<blockquote>Father, I thank You that it is not all over for me. I may be at a low point now, but because of Your presence and favor in my life, You will pull me out of the pit and place me on high ground. I cannot help but experience increase and promotion beyond my wildest dreams because You are with me!</blockquote>
								
								<h2>Today's Thought</h2>
								<blockquote>The same Lord who was with Joseph is with me right now. And like Joseph, I will experience increase and promotion regardless of my circumstances!</blockquote>
