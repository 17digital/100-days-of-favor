								<h2><i>Today's Scripture</i></h2>
								<blockquote>For He [God] made Him [Jesus Christ] who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him [Jesus Christ].&#8212;2 Corinthians 5:21</blockquote>
								
								<p>THERE IS NO doubt that all believers want to experience God's unmerited favor in their lives. All of us want to experience success in our marriages, families, careers, as well as ministries. We all want to enjoy God's best and richest blessings. We want His provision, health and power flowing mightily in our lives, and we know that all these blessings are wrapped up in God's unmerited favor. When His unmerited favor is on your side, nothing can stand against you. But if His favor is unmerited, how can we qualify for it? If we cannot earn, deserve or merit it, how can we be confident that we have His unmerited favor?</p>
								
								<h3>Your righteousness in Christ is the sure foundation on which you can build your expectations to receive God's unmerited favor.</h3>
								
								<p style="text-indent: 30px;">One of the key things that I desire to do in this book is to build upon the existing teachings on favor and to give believers a firm foundation on <strong>why they have the right to God's unmerited favor</strong> in their lives today. Do you know the answers to the following questions?</p>
								
																
								<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Why can you expect good to happen to you?</p>
								
								<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Why can you enjoy God's unmerited favor?</p>
								
								<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Why can you ask God for big things?</p>
								
								<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Beloved, your answers are all found on the Mount of Golgatha, the place of the skull. It's the place where the sinless Man became sin, so that you and I can become the righteousness of God in Him. His righteousness is <strong>your right</strong> to God's unmerited favor.</p>
								
								<p style="text-indent: 30px;">You can expect good…</p>
								
								<p style="text-indent: 30px;">You can enjoy God's unmerited favor…</p>
								
								<p style="text-indent: 30px;">You can ask God for big things…</p>
								
								<p style="text-indent: 30px;">... Because you have been made the righteousness of God through Jesus sacrifice on the cross!</p>
								
								<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Don't just take my word for it. Look at 2 Corinthians 5: 21 again: "For he [God] made Him [Jesus Christ] who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in him [Jesus Christ]."</p>
								
								<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Your righteousness in Christ is the sure foundation on which you can build your expectations to receive God's unmerited favor. God sees you through the lens of the cross of His son, and as Jesus is today deserving of blessings, peace, health, and favor, so are you (1 John 4:17)!</p>
															
															
								<h2><i>Today's Prayer</i></h2>
								<blockquote>Father, I think you that Jesus has paid the price for me to have your unmerited favor. He took my sins and gave me His righteousness. And because I am righteous in Christ, I expect blessings such as peace and health to crown my head. I rest on your Word that declares that as Jesus is, so am I in this world.</blockquote>
								
								<h2>Today's Thought</h2>
								<blockquote>God gives me what Jesus deserves because I am the righteousness of God in Christ.</blockquote>
