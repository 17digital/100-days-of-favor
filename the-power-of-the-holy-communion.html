								<h2>WHAT IS THE HOLY COMMUNION?</h2>
																
								<p>The Holy Communion, known also as the Lord’s Supper, represents the greatest expression of God’s love for His people.</p>
								
								<p>Two items are used in the Holy Communion—the bread which represents Jesus’ body that was scourged and broken before and during His crucifixion, and the cup which represents His shed blood.</p>
								
								<p>When Jesus walked on earth, He was vibrant, and His body was full of life and health. He was never sick. But before Jesus went to the cross, He was badly scourged by the Roman soldiers, and His body was torn as He hung on the cross.</p>
								
								<p>At the cross, God also took all our sicknesses and diseases and put them on Jesus’ originally perfect and healthy body, so that we can walk in divine health. That is why the Bible says by His stripes, we are healed (Isaiah 53:5, 1 Peter 2:24).</p>
								
								<p>In Luke 22:20, Jesus tells us that the cup is the “new covenant in My blood”, and the apostle Paul tells us that the blood of Jesus brings forgiveness of sins (Colossians 1:14, Ephesians 1:7).</p>
								
								<h3>WHY DO BELIEVERS PARTAKE OF THE HOLY COMMUNION?</h3>
								
								<p style="text-indent: 20px;">Besides being born again in Christ, a healthy body and mind are the greatest blessings anyone can have. And the Holy Communion is God’s ordained channel of healing and wholeness.</p>
								
								<p>On the night that He was betrayed, Jesus ate His last supper with His disciples. And knowing what He would accomplish through His sacrifice, He instituted the Holy Communion (Luke 22:19–20, 1 Corinthians 11:24–25).</p>
								
								<p>His loving instruction is that we are to remember Him as we partake of the Holy Communion. Jesus wanted us conscious of how His body was broken for our wholeness, and His blood was shed for the forgiveness of our sins. And whenever we partake in this consciousness, we “proclaim the Lord’s death till He comes” (1 Corinthians 11:26).</p>
								
								<p>Today, when we partake of the bread, we are declaring that Jesus’ health and divine life flows in our mortal bodies. And when we partake of the cup, we are declaring that we are forgiven and have been made righteous. Jesus’ blood gives us right standing before God, and we can go boldly into God’s presence (Hebrews 4:16). When we pray, we can be sure that God hears us!</p>
								
								<h3>HOW DO I PARTAKE OF THE HOLY COMMUNION?</h3>
								
								<p>Before you partake, remember that the Holy Communion is not a ritual to be observed, but a blessing to be received.</p>
								
																
								<p>Because it is not a ritual, there is no prescribed bread or special drink required. In the Last Supper, Jesus used whatever He had at the table—bread commonly eaten at supper, and whatever they were drinking.</p>
								
								<h3>TO PARTAKE, HOLD THE BREAD IN YOUR HAND AND SAY:</h3>
								
								<blockquote>Dear Lord Jesus, I come to You, and remember all that You have done for me on the cross. Thank You for loving me so much, You gave up heaven for me. Thank You for allowing Your body to be broken so that mine might be whole. As I partake, I receive Your resurrection life, health, and strength. By Your grace, I shall be completely strong and healthy all the days of my life. My eyes shall not grow dim, nor shall my strength be abated. No sickness can remain in my body because the same power that raised You from the grave flows through me. By Your stripes, I am healed. [Now eat the bread.]</blockquote>
								
								<h3>NOW HOLD THE CUP IN YOUR HAND AND TELL HIM:</h3>
								

								<blockquote>Lord Jesus, thank You for Your precious blood. Thank You for washing me clean of all my sins. I stand before You completely righteous and forgiven. Your blood has redeemed me from every curse, and today I can freely receive all the blessings that crown the head of the righteous. Amen! [Now drink.]</blockquote>
