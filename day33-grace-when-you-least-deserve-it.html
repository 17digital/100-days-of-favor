								<h2><i>Today's Scripture</i></h2>
								<blockquote>â€¦not having my own righteousness, which is from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith &#8212;Philippians 3:9</blockquote>
								
								<p>THE GRACE OF God is the unearned, undeserved and unmerited favor of God. When God answers you in your most undeserving moment, <strong>that</strong> is grace. <strong>That</strong> is His amazing, unmerited favor! At your lowest point, in your darkest hour, His light shines through for you and you become a recipient of His unmerited favor, and a recipient of favor can't help but want to extend grace to others.</p>
								
								<h3>The more righteousness conscious you are, the more you will experience God's unmerited favor.</h3>
								
								<p style="text-indent: 30px;">My friend, in and of ourselves, we don't deserve anything good. But because we are in Christ and in His righteousness, God will not withhold any blessing from our lives today. Our part is not just struggling in our own works and being independent from God, what to focus on receiving that from Him.</p>
								
																
								<p style="text-indent: 30px;">I believe that the more righteousness-conscious you are, the more you will experience God's unmerited favor. When the voice of disqualification comes to remind you of all the areas that you have fallen short in, <strong>that's</strong> the time to turn to Jesus who qualifies you and hear His voice. That is the true fight of faith! The fight of faith is to fight to believe that you are made righteous by faith and not by works. Paul, speaking of his own achievements under the law, said that he counts them all "as rubbish, that I may gain Christ and be found in Him, not having <strong>my own righteousness, which is from the law</strong>, but that which is through faith in Christ, <strong>the righteousness which is from God by faith</strong>" (Philippians 3:8-9).</p>
								
								<p style="text-indent: 30px;">So there are clearly two types of righteousness in the Bible: (1) A righteousness that comes from your obedience and from your trying to earn your way to attain it. (2) A righteousness that comes from faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
								
								<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Only one of these has a solid, unshakable foundation. One is built upon <strong>you</strong> and <strong>your</strong> ability to keep the law, while the other is built upon the Rock of all ages&#8212;Jesus Christ. One can only give you the occasional confidence to ask for God's favor, depending on how well you perceive you have done. The other gives you confidence ALL THE TIME to access His unmerited favor, even when you feel that you are greatly undeserving.</p>
								
								<p style="text-indent: 30px;">What do you want to depend on when push comes to shove&#8212;your wavering righteousness or the perfect, rock-solid righteousness of Jesus? It is your faith in the righteousness of Jesus that gives you the right to God's unmerited favor. Today, because of what Jesus did on the cross, you can expect good things to happen to you. You can ask God for big things and reach out to the blessed destiny that he has for you and your family. His righteousness is your right to God's unmerited favor! Don't let any voice of accusation tell you otherwise!</p>
								
								
															
															
								<h2><i>Today's Prayer</i></h2>
								<blockquote>Father, I thank you that at my lowest point, in my darkest hour, the light of your favor still shines through to me. I thank you that I can experience good things from you even when I am most undeserving, because it's not about my obedience, but the perfect obedience of your son Jesus at the cross.</blockquote>
								
								<h2>Today's Thought</h2>
								<blockquote>I have access to God's favor all the time, even when I feel most undeserving!</blockquote>
